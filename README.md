# JDAWidgets
Widgets are Swift components that I used in day-to-day iOS Dev life.

Table discloses following functions in order 

##1. Card Layout view
Take away : 
- Card view UI extension
- Extended Layout will avoid overlapping navigation bar over UIView subviews.

##2. Floating lable text field
